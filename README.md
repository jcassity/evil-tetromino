# evil-tetronimo

A school project for my games development class.

Base code came from "Inventing with Python": https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapter7.html

Program was written by Jacob Cassity and [Samuel Mondier](https://gitlab.com/Mondier97)
with music by Bryan Craine.

the game is a variation on tetromino (tetris). We decided to create a more evil version of the game in which
you control 2 blocks at once using the arrow keys and wasd keys. The blocks fall speed also increases whenever you rotate the blocks.

To run the game, just clone the repo and run main.py
